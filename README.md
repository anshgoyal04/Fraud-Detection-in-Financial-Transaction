# Fraud-Detection-in-Financial-Transaction

This project aims to build an efficient fraud detection system for financial transactions. Fraud detection is critical for preventing financial losses, especially in the banking and e-commerce sectors. The dataset used for this analysis consists of anonymized financial transactions, and our goal is to identify anomalies that indicate potential fraud. Given the highly imbalanced nature of the data (with very few fraudulent transactions), the challenge is to develop a model that minimizes both false positives and false negatives.
